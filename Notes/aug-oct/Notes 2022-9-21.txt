Notes:

    TODO:
        Jean is researching T-shirt stuff
        Nicholas is researching which companies to sponsor us
        Natalie and Jonathan will each create a set of fliers and discuss the next meeting
        Nicholas will contact some other robotics teams for outreach
        Expo Maekwerers - Nicholas
        Logan will finish up his design of an x-drive

    Updates:
        Natalie has clarified Nicholas's role in sponsorships which is research(what companies?)
        Escape room is a bit too expensive
            Maybe we could just hang out eating pizza ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
            maybe we could get boba

    Logan's Drive Train Design:
        Octogon shape
        long sides and short sides
        C channels connecting to the short sides which may contain a motor
        (sadly there is no adapter for the motor axel and wheel axel)
        might use 3 gears (maybe a crown) to connect the wheel to the motor
            a lot of friction

    Fundraising/Sponsorships:
        Nicholas needs to find what companies
        Have 2 separate fliers:
            Money info
            Team info
        Nicholas: NO FIXED PRICES because we want wiggle room for companies

    Outreach:
        We might want to contact other teams to see what they are doing
