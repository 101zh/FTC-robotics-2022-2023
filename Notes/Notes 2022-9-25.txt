            Jonathan's flier:
                needs second page
                colors are nice
                6.5/10
            Nicholas's flier:
                the brown color scheme isn't great  
                change the amount of pages to 2-3
                8/10

    Robotic Designs:
        The only designs contending are Brian's, Nicholas's, and Logan's

        Brianâ€™s 2nd design:
            Might not happen
            Viper-slide gets robot to 40inches
            Intake:
                The claw can move up and down the viper slide (unstable)
                Or a conveyer belt

    Team Building:
        Put off till later
