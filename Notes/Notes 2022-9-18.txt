    Updates:
        Natalie Still needs sponsorship flier
        Max made a robot design

    Nicholas's Design(again):
        There was little info
        Design 2:
            Has to turn around
            linear slides
        Design 1:
            The arm can move 360
            free hanging part which allows the cone to always be facing upright
            2 joints 

    Brian's Design:
        Rotating arm
        Linear slide extends the arm
        servos act as a claw
        Claw can rotate to keep cone upright
        Sliders can be improved and stablized more

    Decide on which designs:
        Nicholas's Design is more practical
        But most designs are pretty good
        Design Components:
            X-drive(wheels at 45 angles)
            Free hanging claw
            Aluminum arm?


    Rules:
        Cones/beacons are added into sub-station during the game
            Human player and robot can't be in the sub-station at the same time
            The human player can't hold more than 1 cone at once
            beacons can only be used end game
            beacons have to right side up
        Circuit has to connect 1 corner to the corner diagonally across
            any way possible (diagonally)
        Custom Sleeves will be important because it will score a lot of points during auton
