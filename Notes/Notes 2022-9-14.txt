    Robot Designs:
        Nicholas's Design:
            https://cad.onshape.com/documents/ae3168e7c31d1556949368ea/w/198531f1e5b9c5a525a19608/e/87cbd2f2e4dc878df83f8fb6?renderMode=0&uiState=631e678db7cbd40404099caa
            Linear slide
            so it can reach further
            claw has 1 stationary finger and 1 finger that moves
            wheels act as weight

        Max's Design:
            Drive train
            linear slides on all four corners
            something that connects in the middle
            arm can move 180 and its hand swings freely(like Nicholas's design)
            it can pick up cone
            maybe camera and the robot can self adjust
            Feedback:

        Discussion:
            Max's design is hard to imagine for Natalie
            Nicholas's design looks good


    Design Ideas:
        an extending arm
        Turning the body of the robot like a crane
            (instead of having it go 180)
        X-drive(mecanum wheels)
