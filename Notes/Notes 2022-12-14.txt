Agenda:

    ### Online:
    
    Talk about new stuff on robot:
        Major Overhauls on Coding:
            Sensitivity on the drive train has been decreased
            4 presets:
                Pickup preset: for picking up cones/ground junction
                Low Junc preset: for scoring on low junction
                Mid Junc preset: for scoring on medium junction
                High Junc preset: for scoring on high junction
            2 controllers now control the robot: 1 for drive train; 1 for arm
        Re-mounted control hubs & powerswitch: easier access to wires
        Things that made the robot quicker:
            Geared up elbow
            Changed shoulder motor to 84rpm(stronger)
            Arm was made shorter
        Angle of the guide was changed

    Tell Natalie and Jean to work on Engineering Portfolio
