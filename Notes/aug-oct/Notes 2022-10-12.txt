    Claw Design:
        Claw that picks up from the inside of the cone doesn't work; requires a 3D printer
        We're using last year's design with 1 servo
        Parallel claws?:
            Gravity based design
                - Weights have to be heavier than the cone
                - Weights have to be positioned correctly
            Have a discussion later IRL

    Sponsorship fliers:
        1000$ might be too much money
        We aren't going to change our logo
