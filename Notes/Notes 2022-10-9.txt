    Building Discussion Commence:
    Brian's Design:
        Claw is attached to the side of the viper slide
        Claw will grab the cone
        Then viper slide will go up and put it on
        The viper slide is fixed
    Nicholas's Design:
        3-bars: 1 fixed to the robot, 1 that can rotate on the previous one, and 1 that rotates on the one that can also rotate
        Claw is fixed onto the last bar
        The claw probably can't grab the cone that was on the ground
    Nicholas's Design 2:
        A horizontal linear slide that slides horizontally
        A vertical linear slide that goes up attached to the horizontal one
        A claw attached to the vertical linear slide
        This way it goes out and then it goes up to put the cone on the stick
    Claw Design:
